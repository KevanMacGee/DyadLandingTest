I used Dyad and asked it to make a "businessy landing page". I was using Horizon Beta (ChatGPT-5 checkpoint right before it was released) through the OpenRouter API. The page it created wasn't bad. It had the hallmarks of an AI generated web page, but that is to be expected.

Dyad did its job though and has been great to work with. https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad
